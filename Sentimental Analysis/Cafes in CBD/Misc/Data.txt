 hi yiyangk awhile


 first cafe since back sg cos apparently dis new cafe talk town right buckwheat pancakes berry fruit compote cornflake crumb passion fruit curd thyme infused maple syrup 20 tonnes pancakes australia outstanding although pancake superior fluff gets boring bites perhaps thick syrup given scarce seen cafes countering problem lining additional syrup underneath pancake adding scoop ice cream splitting batter two thinner ones oh compote please
 tbh felt soft serve overly creamy barely melted despite leaving 10 minutes nevertheless got ta applaud plating skills innovation behind dessert recommend 2 share cos overkill may come back sundae flavours pancakes slight disappointment ambience 4 5 seats nearer towards exit nothing special preferred sit inside decor strikingly green minimalistic service 5 5 attentive water food served promptly despite full house festive season
